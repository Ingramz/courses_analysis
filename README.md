# Analysis of ICS courses

The goal of the project is to scrape data(lecture material etc.) from https://courses.cs.ut.ee 
specific to each course. Then extract all the textual data from .pdf, .pptx, html content pages 
and as a final step perform topic analysis over the material with LDA algorithm.
